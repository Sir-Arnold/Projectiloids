# ShootGun-Final
Shoot Game

How to:
To run this game, run the program in a developer interface such as JGrasp or Eclipse. The exported JAR file is included but I'm not certain on how to use it. Make sure if you do download the whole source folder, each java file should be in the same package, as deligated in each class' header where it says "package."
